# Movies-ETL

Using ETL to extract, transform, and load data files - we also clean the data by inspecting, planning, and executing it for our intended purposes. 

## Project Overview

This project's objective is to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We will also need to refactor the existing code to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

## Challenge Overview
For this project, we will need to accomplish the following:

1. Write an ETL function to read three data files,
2. Extract and transform the Wikipedia data,
3. Extract and transform the Kaggle and rating data
4. Load the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database.
